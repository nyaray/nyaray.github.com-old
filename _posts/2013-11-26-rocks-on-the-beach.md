Missing out on the beautiful coast 'cause we're too busy combing the beach for pretty rocks and shiny things.

Look up and admire as far as the eye can see, reach beyond the sea. Keep climbing to get the better views that I know you can reach.

Though you already know this, it can sometimes be hard to notice that you're looking down. Because, how will you see what you're leaving behind when you don't even notice it passing you by?

And as you raise your head to let your eyes reach for the horizon; notice how the ocean is cheering you on, the waves are clapping in anticipation, how the birds are singing gospels to your progress and how the trees leaves are whispering: "what will you do next?"! Look around and start anew. There's nothing left to do.

As far as parting words go, I have this to say: don't worry about grabbing the prettiest things on the beach, there will be new ones there tomorrow.

What once was a postcard, every 7 or so weeks,<br />
has become a 7 day summary of postcard-scenic pictures.

Instant messages, removing all the miles<br />
that we painstakingly put there.

Yet we still remain distant.

<hr />

We've traded hours in airports, planes and crowded trains<br />
for millisecond fibre optics, so everyone hears our complaints.

We're not really present, we're not really gone;<br />
we go out of our way, yet we never get lost.

We still. remain. distant.

<hr />

This city has a skyline that puts our town to shame,<br />
but these electric flames can't quite replace,<br />
what the stars can do back home.

As the buildings tower over me, I know exactly where I am<br />
but there's still something left to figure out<br />
on the subject of where I stand.

But at least I got away.

<hr />

At least I got away.<br />
At last I got a way.

<hr />

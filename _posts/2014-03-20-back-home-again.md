It's apparently a very weird experience coming home after being abroad for 4,5
months. Especially having hitchhiked for 7 weeks, but in that time covering
only slightly less than the flight out of the country to the next,
intermediate, destination. The hitchhiking country being New Zealand, followed
by Australia.

A friend put it into words with a degree of succinctness I can only dream of
achieving; "it's like going to the bathroom to pee and coming back again. Not
much has happened while you've been gone."

Being home again is weird. But it's a good kind of weird.

title: So You Think You Can OOP?

Having a rudimentary understanding of and skills in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP, for short) is something that (and according to me, rightfully so) is expected of most developers that are going to be working in the real world. You should be aware of things like inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, UML diagrams and a bunch of other special words and three letter acronyms (TLA's). But there's more!

<h2>Go Through The Rabbit Hole</h2>

Knowing about classes and all of their entailing concepts with instances, constructors and other things derived from having classes รก la Java/C# is well and good, but is it really enough, and maybe more interestingly, should you be happy with limiting yourself to it?
Obviously, my answer to the question is "no". While the class-based OOP in Java/C# is the one with the widest spread, considering what is included in curriculums and companies technology stacks, it is not the only model of interest when discussing OOP and its different implementations.

If I tell you that classes aren't the only way of achieving inheritance, encapsulation and other nice patterns that allow us to write maintainable code I hope that your reaction is something similar to: "What? Tell me more!", because to me a response like that is a clear sign of someone willing to learn and adjust their beliefs according to new findings. A person like that is prone to developing their skills in a much sounder (and meaningful) way than someone who dismisses ideas just because they don't make sense immediately.

We should always strive towards information that makes us reconsider things and change our views rather than just cementing them as if there existed any absolute truth, but I won't get into that topic right now due to its rather philosophical nature.

<h2>Prototypical Inheritance, In Depth</h2>

Since I'm not going to do your homework, as there's a ton of resources online, I'll only show you a simple trick for how code re-use is implemented with prototypical inheritance in ECMAScript (a.k.a. Javascript):

I've worked as a teaching assistant on a summer course about front-end development at Uppsala University, created a prototype of a mobile website for students of my faculty with four other students (as in gotten paid to do it) and worked as a consultant writing reusable javascript while using sencha touch to implement interfaces. I've also developed a prototype of an iPhone application.

Most (if not all) of my developing efforts have been done with the use of open source tools (MacVim, the LAMP stack, Sencha Touch, jQuery, to name a few things) and open standards (HTML(5), CSS(3), JavaScript).
